      <p>The following exercises are designed to help the students understand simple past and future tense.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Week 20: Explain simple future tense using Simple Future Tense and remind them of the differences between future and past tense. Then play Past and Future.
        This game is the same as the game we have been playing in the previous weeks. There are two players, A and B. Each player is shown their schedule for this week. On each day they did a different thing. The teacher can click on a day, at random, in the players’ schedule to highlight an activity. Start the timer by clicking the button at the top. The pair of players then have one minute to score as many points as possible.
        In his version of the game the TODAY symbol is in the middle of the week. If the activity is before today, then someone will ask: “What did you do on _?” and the other person will reply using the past tense phrase that they previously learnt. If the activity is after today, the person whose turn it is asks: “What are you going to do on ___?” The other person in the pair will reply: “I'm going to ___.” If the pair correctly asked and answered the question the teacher can press SPACE to give them a point. 
        Note: If someone is asking about TODAY the person asking could ask about something the other person did or is going to do. The other player should then reply using the same tense. 
      </h3>
      <br><br>
      <p>The first two exercises in the menu cover simple present tense. The third and fourth exercises explain simple past tense. The fifth exercise asks the students to use the past tense for the same phrases they were taught in second activity. In the last activity they play a question and answer game covering the past tense phrases they have learnt.</p>
      <h3>Simple Present Tense: Table</h3>
      <p>The students are reminded of what a verb is and are shown 20 common English verbs. The table can be used to hide the English or Japanese words by clicking on the eye at the top or by clicking on individual words. You can use the table to test whether the students know the verbs.</p>
      <h3>Simple Present Tense: Phrases</h3>
      <p>
        The students are shown the same 20 verbs being used in context. Once the students have been introduced to the phrases hide the verb or the whole phrase by clicking the buttons at the bottom. The English phrase can then be clicked on to reveal the answer.
        Note: Remind the students that directly translating the phrases/verbs should often be avoided. Instead, they should think about how the phrases would be said in English.

      <h3>Simple Past Tense: Regular Verbs</h3>
      <p>
        Explain to the students how to conjugate regular verbs in the simple past tense. Help the students understand how to pronounce the ‘ed’ ending as /t/, /d/ or /id/. There are five examples for each pronunciation. </p>

The pair of players then have one minute to score as many points as possible.
        The pair of players then have one minute to score as many points as possible. The pair of players take it in turn to ask each other: “What did you do on ___?”. The other player replies by saying “I ___.” Followed by the past tense phrase that matches the picture. If the pair correctly asked and answered the question the teacher can press SPACE to give them a point. 
        Note: If there is only one student then the teacher will be one of the players in the pair. For two or three students the teacher may want to pair up with each person. When there are four or six students, the teacher can create two or three teams respectively. If there are five students, the teacher can pair with one student and then go first. The following two teams can then play to try and beat the teacher’s score.
