      <h1>Past Tense: Regular Verbs</h1>
      <section>
        <p>There are two kinds of verbs regular verbs and irregular verbs. Regular verbs have a rule when we make them past tense, we add ‘ed’ to the end of the word:</p>
        <br>
        <p class="center">動詞の原形 + ed</p>
        <p class="center">walk ⇒ walked</p>
        <br>
        <p>Note: If a regular verb ends with consonant + y, we change ‘y’ to ‘i’ then add ‘ed’. Remember that the vowels are; a, e, i, o, u. Consonants are the other letters.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="center">study ⇒ studied</p>
        <p class="center">play ⇒ played</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>The ‘ed’ added to the end of each verb can be pronounced three different ways:</p>
        <br>
        <p class="center">/t/ 	/d/   /id/</p>
        <br>
        <p>Consonants can be voiced or unvoiced. Voiced consonants make your vocal cords vibrate when you say them. For example, try putting you hand on your throat and making the sounds /b/, /g/ and /z/. Unvoiced sounds do not vibrate the vocal cords in this way. For example, /f/, /p/ and /s/.</p>

      <section>
        <p>If the simple present tense verb ends with an unvoiced sound, we pronounce the ‘ed’ as /t/:</p>
        <br>
        <div class="table table1"></div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>If the simple present tense verb ends with a voiced sound, we pronounce the ‘ed’ as /d/.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="table table2"></div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>If the simple present tense verb ends with ‘d’ or ‘t’, we pronounce the ‘ed’ as /id/.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="table table3"></div>
